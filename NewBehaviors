If current block minerâ€™s address ends in b, allow them to burn any amount, as long as that amount is less than or equal to what they have in their account

The miner who mines the first block of every leap year will be minted double the amount they have currently in their account

If the current block timestamp contains 4:20 in it, give the current block miner 1.5 times the reward
